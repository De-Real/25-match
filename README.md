## Game logic

Welcome to the "Match Pile Game"! This is a strategic game where two players take turns removing matches from a pile. The goal is to be the player who takes the last match from the pile, but with a twist. The game is played with a pile of 2n + 1 matches, where n is a parameter chosen by the players. Each player can take 1 to m matches on their turn, with m being another adjustable parameter. The game requires both careful planning and adaptability to outsmart your opponent and secure a win.

The AI opponent utilizes an optimal strategy to determine its moves. It takes into account the number of matches remaining and the user's previous move. In the early stages of the game, the AI may choose its moves randomly. However, as the game progresses, the AI becomes more strategic. It ensures that it takes the appropriate number of matches to maintain a winning position whenever possible. It also adjusts its strategy based on the values of n and m chosen by the players.

By employing smart tactics and thinking ahead, you can challenge the AI opponent and aim to claim victory in this exciting Match Pile Game!
